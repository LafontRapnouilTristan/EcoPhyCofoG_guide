\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

Plant functional traits are the features (morphological, physiological, phenological) that represent ecological strategies and determine \emph{describe?} how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels and influence ecosystem properties.
Variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardized ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits.
The importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardized protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant- and ecosystem-level processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily (Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013)

This handbook presents the different protocols used in EcoFoG's ecophysio lab.
We therefore suggest the methodological principles for a more open and transparent science.
This handbook not only includes updated methods for the trait measurements, but also includes the excel worksheets for data collection and links toward detailed tutorial or user's guide for all methods used in this lab.
This handbook will be associated with an R package \protect\hyperlink{ecophycofog-package}{EcophyCofog} containing some useful homemade functions to deal with some devices output.

\mainmatter

\hypertarget{handbook-architecture}{%
\chapter{Handbook architecture}\label{handbook-architecture}}

This handbook is written for operational ends. As such, it is not a review or scientific paper thoroughly presenting each traits but rather a list of protocols associated with routinely measured traits in this lab.

Each chapter of this book correspond to one trait and associated measurement process.

\hypertarget{shoot-traits}{%
\section{Shoot traits}\label{shoot-traits}}

Shoot traits refer to all morpho-anatomical traits that can be measured on plant aerial part.
Most of these traits are measured on the leaves but see \protect\hyperlink{stem}{Stem} section.

\hypertarget{mass-associated-traits}{%
\subsection{Mass associated traits}\label{mass-associated-traits}}

Plant growth strategies and overall performances are often assessed via mass associated traits.
Three masses are used to calculate different metrics.
The \emph{Fresh Mass} (\textbf{FM}) which is the weight of freshly sampled leaves.
The \emph{Turgid Mass} (\textbf{TM}) which is the mass of fully hydrated leaves.
Leaf hydratation protocols are source of debate in EcoFog but are presented {[}here{]}{[}Leaf hydratation{]}
And the \emph{Dry Mass} (\textbf{DM}) which is the mass of dryed leaves.

To be compared, these weights must come from the same sample and we must measure the leaf projected surfaces.
See \protect\hyperlink{leaf-surface}{here} for the leaf surface measurements protocols.

From these masses and surfaces are calculated metrics such as SLA/LMA, RWC, LDMC, WHC (\protect\hyperlink{calculation}{Calculation}).

\textcolor{red}{Use the same balance for all you masses within an experiment!!}

\hypertarget{leaf-surface}{%
\subsubsection{Leaf surface}\label{leaf-surface}}

Most of leaf surfaces are obtained from leaf scans using office scanner.
The used scanners are \href{document/machine/EPSON_V800/usersguide.pdf}{EPSON's V800}.
To acquire leaf scans please see \protect\hyperlink{image-acquisition}{Image Acquisition}.
Depending on your research question you can either scan one leaf or several leaves (to have total leaf surface of your plant for instance).

Once you have one scan per experimental unit you need to extract its surface.
Surface measurements are made with the \href{document/software/ImageJ/user-guide-A4booklet.pdf}{\texttt{ImageJ}} freeware.
\texttt{ImageJ} works on all \texttt{OS} and can be downloaded {[}here{]}{[}\url{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html}{]}

Surface can be measured \textbf{manually} or \textbf{automatically}

\textbf{Manual measurements} :

Launch imageJ -\textgreater{} File -\textgreater{} Open (Ctrl + O) and browse for the picture you want to analyse.

Then select the \texttt{polygon\ selection} tool \ref{fig:polygon}.

\scriptsize

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{document/trait/shootmorpho/polygon_selection_imageJ} 

}

\caption{Polygon selection tool in ImageJ}\label{fig:polygon}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

Zoom (\texttt{-}/\texttt{+} or \texttt{Ctrl+wheel\ in/out}) into your image to see only the leaf you want to measure \ref{fig:zoomin}.

\scriptsize

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{document/trait/shootmorpho/Zoomin} 

}

\caption{Zooming in ImageJ}\label{fig:zoomin}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

Then you can \texttt{left\ click} to detour your leaf \ref{fig:detouring}.
The more points you have the more precise and close to the leaf your measruments will be.
However, bear in mind that this is laborious and that as your zoomed in your error should be negligeable.

\scriptsize

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{document/trait/shootmorpho/detouring_leaf} 

}

\caption{Leaf detouring in ImageJ}\label{fig:detouring}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

Once you've closed your polygon, press \texttt{ctrl+M}.
A window containing the results will pop-up \ref{fig:ctrlmpopup}.

\scriptsize

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{document/trait/shootmorpho/ctrlMpopup} 

}

\caption{Results window in ImageJ}\label{fig:ctrlmpopup}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

The Area will be expressed in the units of your photo.
Some pictures have embedded scales in cm or inches but the default is usually in pixels (px).
For more information see {[}ImageJ scale{]}.

Each measurements will be added to the results window (one each time you press \texttt{ctrl+M}).
You can then save this window in the \texttt{.csv}format clicking on \texttt{File}, \texttt{Save\ As} and browse for chosen location.
You can either have one file per photo (i.e.~sample) and then name your file as your sample ID.
Or you can decide to have one file for all your samples.
Then you have to remember or write somewhere which measurements ID is associated to each of your samples to find who's who \ref{fig:measid}.

\scriptsize

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{document/trait/shootmorpho/measurementID} 

}

\caption{Measurement ID in ImageJ}\label{fig:measid}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

\textbf{Automatic measurements}:

This will allow you to analyze many data at the same time.
To do so you will need to use an homemade ImageJ macro.

\href{document/software/ImageJ/macro.txt}{Macro exemple}.
This macro is used to convert your colored scans in 8 bit black and white pictures.
Then it set scale for 800 ppi scans (distances=800px known = 2.54 cm , pixel = 1).
With ppi -\textgreater{} pixel per inch and 1 inch = 2.54cm.
The pixel ratio is 1 as vertical and horizontal resolution is the same.
It sets the contrast and then anaylze size of particle bigger than 0.01 cm\^{}2 and smaller than infinity.
It displays the results in summarize form for each pictures in the folder.

See \href{https://exeter-data-analytics.github.io/imagej-gui/macros.html}{here} for a tutorial on macro recording in imageJ.

To launch a batch process go to \texttt{Process}-\textgreater{} \texttt{Batch}-\textgreater{} \texttt{Macro...}.
This will open a window.
Fill the fields as follow:
+ \texttt{Input}: folder containing your pictures to be annalyzed
+ \texttt{Output}: folder to receive your output.
+ \texttt{Output\ format}: quite clear!

\hypertarget{stomata-and-trichomes-density}{%
\subsubsection{Stomata and trichomes density}\label{stomata-and-trichomes-density}}

Stomata and trichomes density are acquired via epidermis printing.
First, apply double sided tape on your leaf and remove it.
You now have a piece of tape with your trichomes on it.
Place it on a glass-slide with the trichome-covered side on the top.

Then, to get your stomata, apply a thin coat of transparent nail polish and let it to dry.
Then you remove it with double-sided tape and put it on a glass slide (nail polish on top).

Observations are made with the \href{document/machine/Olympus\%20BX51/olympus_bx-51_bx52_microscope_manual.pdf}{\texttt{Olympus\ BX51}} microscope.

And pictures are taken with the installed camera (currently \href{document/machine/Lumenera\%20LW1135C-IO/Lumenera-USB-GigE-Camera-User-Manual.pdf}{\texttt{Lumenera\ LW1135C-IO}} but about to change).

Pictures can then be uploaded in ImageJ and you can manually count stomata and trichomes using the \texttt{multipoint} tool.

\textbf{There is a new opportunity to use \texttt{LabelStoma}, a deep leaning software for stomata detection.
It is developed by Ángela Casado-García and we are trying to make it work on some species that we study at EcoFog.}

\hypertarget{anatomical-structure}{%
\subsubsection{Anatomical structure}\label{anatomical-structure}}

Leaf anatomical observations are made on razor blade hand-made cross sections of leaves.

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{document/trait/shootmorpho/bromecut1} 

}

\caption{Hand made cross section of a bromeliad leaf}\label{fig:bromecut}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

These cuts are directly placed in water/oil on a glass-slide and observed with the \href{document/machine/Olympus\%20BX51/olympus_bx-51_bx52_microscope_manual.pdf}{\texttt{Olympus\ BX51}} microscope.

And pictures are taken with the installed camera (currently \href{document/machine/Lumenera\%20LW1135C-IO/Lumenera-USB-GigE-Camera-User-Manual.pdf}{\texttt{Lumenera\ LW1135C-IO}} but about to change).

\textcolor{red}{Always use the same picture format!!}
We recommend \texttt{JPEG} or \texttt{TIFF}.

On these pictures you can then make measurements such as width of the epidermis and cuticle.
The width of certain type of tissue (chlorenchyma, parenchyma, hydrenchyma) or the distance between vessels using ImageJ tools such as the \texttt{draw\ segment} and \texttt{ctrl+M} output (area, angle of the line and length).

\hypertarget{root-traits}{%
\section{Root traits}\label{root-traits}}

Root morphology analysis (length, diameter, etc.) are conducted using the Winrhizo software.

Winrhizo is a licenced software created by Regent Instrument Canada Inc.~It exist 4 different version and we own the \emph{Basic Version}. It allows root morphology analysis from scans.

\hypertarget{image-acquisition}{%
\subsection{Image Acquisition}\label{image-acquisition}}

\hypertarget{format}{%
\subsubsection{Format}\label{format}}

Supported image format are \texttt{.TIFF}, \texttt{.JPEG} and \texttt{.BMP}. \texttt{.TIFF}and \texttt{.BMP} are not compressed and are thus to be preferred. \texttt{.TIFF} images are compatible with all OS and should be privileged but you must be careful to save them \emph{uncompressed} as \texttt{WinRhizo} won't be able to open \emph{compressed} ones.

The higher the resolution, the more pixel you will have and the more precise will be your measurements. However, with resolution, scan time and image size increase. 800DPI is the standard in this lab but 400 is the winrhizo recommendation. This depend on the required level of precision as well as the size of the analyzed roots ( the finer the higher must be the resolution to get more details).

\hypertarget{scanner}{%
\subsubsection{Scanner}\label{scanner}}

Any scanner can be used to acquire scans for Winrhizo software. However, be sure that the format is compatible and that all the images inside your project are saved in the same format and the same resolution. For coherence purposes we encourage you to use the same formats between studies at Ecofog's lab scale.
\href{document/machine/EPSON_V800/usersguide.pdf}{EPSON's V800} scanners are the ones used as this document is being written. The scanner model isn't important but we recommend to use scanners with a transparent (double-lamp) option. This will allow cleaner root scans for complex root systems.
And the scanning software is \href{https://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/epson.html}{VueScan}

\hypertarget{flat-scan}{%
\paragraph{Flat scan}\label{flat-scan}}

You can decide to use basic scan options with light only coming from below. If you do so you need to have a white background installed under the scanner's roof (if black roots, if pale ones you'll need a black background).

Choosing this option will simplify your protocol and can suffice for simple and thin enough root systems.

\hypertarget{transparent}{%
\paragraph{Transparent}\label{transparent}}

If your root are too big \ref{fig:bigroots}, then self-shading can appear on flat scan and bias winrhizo's analysis. To avoid this shading you can remove the background from the scanner's roof to enable double-lamp scanning. The light coming from top and bottom as one, shading will be avoid and scans will be cleaner.

\caption{Roots to thick to be flat scanned}\label{fig:bigroots}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

Another case where you can prefer \texttt{Transparent} option is for complex root systems (e.g.~bromeliaceae, \ref{fig:bromeroot}) . For this type of roots, you can scan them in a thin coat of water to disentangle fine roots. Doing so you will have a better analysis of the root system morphology and structure but once again have shading issue. Supressing them requires the use of the \texttt{Transparent} mode.

\textbf{BEWARE:} The \texttt{Transparent} scan window is smaller than the normal mode scan. The actual scanned zone is showed \ref{fig:scantransp} and you must make sure that you roots are well placed within this area.

\hypertarget{image-processing}{%
\subsection{Image processing}\label{image-processing}}

To analyze with winrhizo, you can either make it manually, one image at a time and by drawing rectangles around the roots you want to analyze.
However, when having a lot of scans you might want to automatize the process using the \texttt{batch} option.
If this is your choice, make sure that your images only contain roots!! Sometimes you will have to remove some parts of the scans to leave only roots in your images.
For instance, this \ref{fig:bromescan} is the scan from bromeliads roots. We can see the water-filled petri dishes border on the scan and this will be an issue for automatized Winrhizo analysis.

To re-crop these images we use the freeware \texttt{XnConvert}.
The petri dish has always been placed in the same place using a stencil \ref{fig:scanstencil} on the scan window, enabling us to recrop all scans to the same size.

To be used you need to copy the software from the disk to your computer and install the protection key drivers (also on the CD). Once installed you don't need the CD to run the software but the protection key must be plugged.
Unplugging it will prevent any use of the software.

\hypertarget{startup}{%
\subsubsection{Startup}\label{startup}}

\hypertarget{first-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{First analysis}\label{first-analysis}}

Once you have acquired your images and launched winrhizo you can start to analyze your scans.
To display a single scan, click \emph{Image} -\textgreater{} \emph{Origin} -\textgreater{} \emph{From File}.
Then you can click the \emph{acquisition }icon \textbf{PIC}.
This will open a standard document opening window.
Then you browse normally to find the wanted scan.
Make sure that you are looking for the goor format, by default, winrhizo display \texttt{.TIFF}.
When you open it, winrhizo display the targeted image and you can then click on it (analyze whole image) or make a selection (only selected region) to start an analysis.

When an image or region is analyzed, winrhizo display the \emph{sample identification} window which allows you to enter information about the sample.
These information will be saved with the measurements data.
In this window click \emph{OK} to do the analysis or \emph{Cancel} to abort it.

After you clicked \emph{OK}, winrhizo starts the analysis (can be stopped pressing \emph{S}).
When done, winrhizo is ready to save the data but a file must be opened or created first.
Winrhizo display a window which asks wether to \emph{open one}, \emph{create one} or \emph{save nothing}.
Selecting \emph{create one} will create a new \texttt{.TXT} file to store analysis data (more info about output \protect\hyperlink{output}{here}).
Selecting \emph{open one} will allow you to open a pre-existing file to add the new measurements at the end of this file.
Clicking on \emph{save nothing}, guess?

In the image, you can now see which roots have been analyzed.
This have a skeleton line over them.
The absence of this skeleton indicates that these roots have not been analyzed.
This can be due to non-optimal pixel classification (see more about it \protect\hyperlink{pixel-classification}{here}).

WELL DONE! You just analyze your first picture!

You can practice with scans available \protect\hyperlink{resources}{here}

\hypertarget{calibration}{%
\subsubsection{Calibration}\label{calibration}}

If not calibrated (associated with a scale), winrhizo will display results in pixels.
\texttt{.TIFF} files have an embedded scale, automatically detected by winrhizo.
Check on your results if they are in px (pixels), in (inches) or cm (centimeters).

However, you can sometimes have uncalibrated files (mistakes or images from camera).
Thus, you will need to ``manually'' calibrate your image.
Winrhizo calibration files are saved as \texttt{.CAL}. In the \emph{Calibration} menu you can load pre-existing calibration files.
You will find the \texttt{calib\_imge.TIFF} \href{document/trait/rootmorpho/calib_imge.TIF}{here}.
To make your calibration at any DPI, you can print this image and scan it at the wanted DPI.
The black square in the image delimit a white 1x1cm square.
Loading this image in winrhizo, you can click on \emph{calibration} -\textgreater{} \emph{pixel size method} -\textgreater{} \emph{object of known dimension} -\textgreater{} \emph{1 image} -\textgreater{} width=1 , height=1, border=0.35, units=cm -\textgreater{} \emph{Ok}

Then, winrhizo will propose you to save the calibration in a \texttt{.CAL} file that can be loaded later and used for all your images at a given resolution. \textcolor{red}{DO NOT NAME YOUR FILE Scanner.cal}.
Please, when you create a \texttt{.CAL} at a previously not used resolution, store a copy of the calibration file \href{document/software/Winrhizo/}{here} so that your work helps your successors!!

\hypertarget{batch}{%
\subsubsection{Batch}\label{batch}}

We saw how to analyze a \protect\hyperlink{first-analysis}{single picture or region} but you might have numerous scans to analyze and want to automatize this process.
To do so you will give winrhizo a \emph{batch} (i.e.~a folder) containing any number of images you want.

\hypertarget{pixel-classification}{%
\subsubsection{Pixel classification}\label{pixel-classification}}

Pixel classification is how winrhizo discriminate between actual ``root'' pixels and scan background.
To do this distinction you have several options presented in \emph{Analysis} -\textgreater{} \emph{Root \& Background Distinction} menu.
This distinction is made grey levels and can either be set to \emph{automatic} or \emph{manual}.
Automatic option either sets a global threshold (default) of grey value at which the pixel is attributed to roots or background or it can be used with \emph{lagarde} options which consider local region (region size can be defined in pixels) of the picture and associate different threshold values.
We don't recommend the use of \emph{lagarde} option but a careful cleaning of your roots and high quality scans.
However you can test different options with some of your scans to chose the best options.
It is also important to tell the software if your scans are Dark roots on White background or the contrary.

\chapter{Fluorescence}\label{fluorescence}}

Fluorescence measurements are made with the \href{document/machine/MiniPAM\%20II/minipamexp.pdf}{\texttt{MiniPAM\ II}} fluorometer.
It is used to assess the efficiency of plant photosystems to convert light into chemical energy.

\href{document/trait/fluorescence/Maxwell\%20and\%20Johnson\%20-\%202000\%20-\%20Chlorophyll\%20fluorescence—a\%20practical\%20guide.pdf}{Maxwell and Johnson \emph{2000}} provided a good synthesis of the theories behind these measurements.

A french and detailed version of Fluorescence measurements is available \href{document/machine/MiniPAM\%20II/Manuel\%20Mini-PAM\%20II6300_\%20Maxime\%20B}{here}

\hypertarget{theory}{%
\section{Theory}\label{theory}}

We will try to summarize it a bit here.
Light energy is either converted into \texttt{Photochemical\ energy}, \texttt{fluorescence} or \texttt{heat}.
Measuring fluorescence can give information about the other if we control one (i.e.~photochemistry).

We use the \texttt{Kautsky\ effect}, a variation of the \texttt{fluorescence} pattern when exposing the leaf to light.
When passing from darkness to light, photon will saturate the plant photosystem II and e\^{}- acceptors.
The PSII are sayed ``closed'' until e\textsuperscript{-} go down the reaction chain.

Thus, for a few seconds, the system cannot do photochemistry and only emits fluo (measurable) and heat!!!

After this period, the fluorescence starts to fall again ==\textgreater{} \texttt{fluorescence\ quenching}

Because :

1 - e- transfer away from the PSII increases with light activated enzymes : \textbf{photochemical quenching}

2 - Heat energy estimation : \textbf{Non-photochemical quenching}

\textasciitilde{} 15 to 20 min are needed to reach the equilibrium but it varies between species.

For usefull informations, we need to supress one of the 2 (typically 1).
Indeed, if no photochemical quenching (PQ), then we only have non-photochemical quenching (NPQ).

We thus use the \texttt{light\ doubling\ technique}.

An high intensity-short duration flash closes all PSII.

During this flash, the fluorescence yield reach values attained with no NPQ (\(F_m\)).

\(F_0\) is the fluorescence level when no actinic light (darkening + far red to open reaction centers).

\(F_t\) is the steady state of fluorescence in actinic light.

NPQ can too change with time and this is reflected as \(F_m\) changes when PQ is off/negligible.

We can then calculate :

\(\phi _{SII} = \frac{F'_m-F_t}{F'_m}\) which is the proportion of light absorbed by PSII chlorophyll and used for photochemistry.

and :

\(qP = \frac{F'_m-F_t}{F'_m-F'_0}\) the proportion of closed PSII reaction center, it increases with plant stress.

\(F_v/F_m=\frac{\phi _{PSII}}{qP}=\frac{F'_m-F'_0}{F'_m}\) or with \(F°_m\) and \(F°_0\) in the dark adapted state.

\hypertarget{fv.fm}{%
\section{Fv.Fm}\label{fv.fm}}

To measure Fv/Fm with the MiniPAM you have to use the dark leaf clip and place one on the target leaf for 30 minutes dark adaptation.
Then press record on the MiniPAM screen to create a new data entry.
And, finally just insert the optical fiber in the leaf clip, open it and press Fv/Fm on the MiniPAM screen.
You can either note the displayed value manually or extract it later with the MiniPAM associated software \href{https://www.walz.com/products/chl_p700/mini-pam-II/downloads.html}{\texttt{Wincontrol}}.
If you chose the later, do note the correspondence between your subject ID and the record created by the MiniPAM.

\hypertarget{etrmax}{%
\section{ETRmax}\label{etrmax}}

To measure ETRmax, a leaf is quasi-dark acclimated for 150s in an opaque plastic bag before gradual exposition to increasing PAR values in twelve 30s steps ranging from 50 to 3000 µmol photon m-2 s -1.
ETR is obtained using the WinControl-3 software (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) and an R script chosing between two models (Reg1, with photoinhibition, and Reg2, without) given by Platt et al.~(1980).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Attach the fibre optic cable to the leaf clip holder and use a stand if necessary.
\item
  Hold the leaf clip holder firmly to the sheet to be measured (avoid the ribs if possible).
\item
  Place the leaf clip holder in the dark for 150 seconds: cover it so that it is not in contact with the ambient light (quasi-dark adaptation)
\item
  On the screen (Basic data), press the arrow pointing downwards until you see the Light curve, and then press \textbf{START}.
\item
  At the end of the measurement, the curve and all data will be saved automatically.
\item
  The only way to retrieve the data is to note the time the RLC was started.
\end{itemize}

For the curves, the plant must remain in the dark until the end of the curve and above all not move the leaf clip holder so that the flash of light remains in the same place.

See \protect\hyperlink{ecophycofog-package}{EcophyCofog Package} for more information on the package.

First, if your download resulted in several \texttt{.csv} files, you have to run the \texttt{merge\_minipam}.
Place all your files (and only them!!) in a folder.

\normalsize

Then you'll run the \texttt{minipam} function on your merged file.
NOTE that you can also chose not to merge your files and process them individually with \texttt{minipam}.

To run this function you'll need a \emph{ID\_match} \texttt{.csv} file.
It's a file with 4 columns: \textbf{ID} (ID of measured plant, leaf, sample), \textbf{Date} (date of the measurement, DD:MM:YYYY format), \textbf{Time} (Hour at which started the measurement HH:MM format), \textbf{REC} (the MiniPAM record ID)

This template is based on \emph{Bookdown} and the \emph{Memoir} LaTeX class to allow writing a book, a report, a PhD thesis, etc. in \emph{R Markdown}.

The main file is \emph{index.Rmd} which contains the description of the book in its header. All other \emph{.Rmd} files in the folder contain a chapter.
The \emph{references.bib} file contains the bibliography.

This file will have to be deleted, as well as \emph{81-getting\_started.Rmd} and \emph{82-syntax.Rmd}: they have to be replaced by the content of the book.

To get started, create a new R project from this folder.
Then open \emph{index.Rmd} and click on the \emph{Build Book} button in the \emph{Build} window of Rstudio.
